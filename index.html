        <p>
            MyMathLab access is required for submitting homework assignments.  You can
            access a digital copy of the Trigonometry, 10th ed. from within MyMathLab.
            If you prefer a physical copy, feel free to purchase (or rent) a copy
            but it's not strictly necessary.  You may instead want to consider purchasing
            a used copy of the 9th edition if you prefer a physical copy.  This
            option is about $20 cheaper and should cover most of the material found
            in the 10th edition that we will be following.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can obtain an account for MyMathLab by following these <a href="registration.pdf">instructions</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A scientific calculator will be required.  Though I am considering the
            option of allowing students use scientific calculators on their phone
            if they so desire.  But not the kind that allows you to take pictures
            of the problem and solve it for you... no, that's cheating :)

                    <h3>Grades</h3> Final grades calculated from the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>70% &nbsp; - 8 Chapter Quizzes (lowest grade dropped)</li>
                        <li>15% &nbsp; - 1 Final Exam</li>
                        <li>15% &nbsp;&nbsp; - Homework (submitted in MyMathLab)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>

            <li> <h3>Missed Exames</h3> One missed exam may be made-up during the course for any reason. Makeup exams must be scheduled  within one week of the original exam date.   Any exam that is missed and not made up will be scored as a zero. In the absence of a documented disability, exams must be completed in the time allotted.</li>

            <li> <h3>Attendance</h3> Any student who is recorded as absent for more than 25% of scheduled classes, will have his/her grade reduced by one full letter grade. A student who is recorded as absent for more that 40% of scheduled classes or who misses the final exam will be given a grade of F1-failure based on non-completion of the course.</li>

            <li> <h3>Withdrawl</h3> As per MATC policy, any student who wishes to do so may withdraw prior to the completion of 90% of the course. The instructor has no power to withdraw a student from the course. (See <a href="http://matcmadison.edu/program-and-coursewithdrawals">http://matcmadison.edu/program-and-coursewithdrawals</a>) </li>

            <li> <h3>Academic Integrity</h3> Policies regarding cheating and other misconduct will be strictly adhered to. It is your responsibility to review these policies on the MATC website: <a href="http://matcmadison.edu/academic-integrity">http://matcmadison.edu/academic-integrity</a>.</li>
